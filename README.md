🛡️ AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System
This project demonstrates an AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning (Random Forest) to detect DDoS attacks in network traffic.
It also integrates Generative AI (Grok) to explain why a network packet is classified as malicious or benign.
The model is trained on a real-world dataset from CIC-IDS2017 and helps simulate how AI can assist cybersecurity analysis.

🚀 How It Works
Train the Random Forest model using the provided dataset
Simulate a random network packet from the test data
Classify the packet as BENIGN or DDoS
(Optional) Use Grok AI to generate an explanation for the prediction
